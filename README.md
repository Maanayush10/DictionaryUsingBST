Dictionary Implementation using BST (Binary Search Tree)

I have implemented a simple dictionary using BST (Binary Search Tree). It has the following functions:
1. Insert- For inserting a new word with its meaning.
2. Search- For seaching a particular word inside a dictionary.
3. Traversal- For Traversing the entire dictionary alphabetically, using Inorder Traversal.

The above program is implemented in C language.
